## About
`datamine` is a Gleam package built for making accessing Minecraft data easy.
It's intended use is for code generation but has many other applications.
This package is heavily inspired by the [`minecraft-data`](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/minecraft-data) project.

## Roadmap
This project is in an extremely alpha phase, so there's a lot that needs to be added.
Also, this project mostly acts a learning opportunity for myself, so I have no dates planned for features.
But, Here's a small breakdown of some of the things that are on my mind for the future:

- More Supported Versions
- More Data Points (Registries, blocks, items, etc.)
- Data Generation (From [`minecraft-data`](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/minecraft-data) and [Minecraft data generators](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Minecraft_Wiki:Projects/wiki.vg_merge/Data_Generators))
